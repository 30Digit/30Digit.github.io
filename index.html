          <h3>Discuss your needs</h3>
          <p>We'll explore your business or work either over the phone, or in person (perhaps with tea and cake!). By the end of the meeting we'll have a thorough understanding of your requirements and how a website can best help you.</p>

          <p>Next, we'll send you a comprehensive proposal which includes a description of the work to be done, timescales, price and terms and conditions. Once confirmed, we'll work from your feedback until you are happy that you have the website you want.</p>
